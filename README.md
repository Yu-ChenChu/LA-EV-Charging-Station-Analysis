# LA-EV-Charging-Station-Analysis
DESCRIPTION:

This is a final project of Urban Data Science class (URBN PL 213) at the University of California Los Angeles.
------------------
PROJECT OVERVIEW:

The increasing popularity of electric vehicles (EVs) has led to a growing demand for EV charging stations. To meet this demand, both the public and private sectors are actively installing additional charging infrastructure. Understanding the key attributes and location characteristics of EV charging stations is essential for gaining insights into installation patterns. This study focuses on the Los Angeles area and aims to develop a predictive model that identifies the factors contributing to the high concentration of EV charging stations. Additionally, the project explores opportunities for improving the existing infrastructure.

STRUCTURE:

This Git Repository organizes the analysis into six main parts: project overview, data request, merging data, data analysis, machine learning, and conclusion. These sections can be found in the Final Report folder under the '4_FinalReport' directory.

NOTE:

The '1_DataRequest', '2_CreateDataset', and '3_MachineLearning' folders serve as references for creating the Final Report.
